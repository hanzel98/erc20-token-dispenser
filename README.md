# ERC20 Token Dispenser

## Instructions

Design and code a smart contract (or set of smart contracts) that will distribute ERC20 tokens over time, on a predetermined schedule.

The system must provide a mechanism to distribute the tokens monthly. This could be in one or many payments, what is important is that under no circumstances we distribute more than the specified amount in any month.
